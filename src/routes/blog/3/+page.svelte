This isn't science fiction—it's the reality of smart materials transforming how we design residential flats, commercial spaces, office interiors, and retail environments.",
                "Traditional interior design treats materials as static elements, but smart materials bring responsive intelligence to everything from flat renovations to office layouts. Whether you're planning a home interior, commercial fit-out, or retail space design, understanding these technologies helps you make decisions that save money while creating spaces that adapt to your changing needs.",
